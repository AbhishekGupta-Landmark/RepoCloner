❌ Problem 2: Missing AI Configuration Arguments
The script is being called without the AI settings:

# Current call (missing AI args):
py scripts/default.py repo_url repo_path
# Should be:
py scripts/default.py repo_url repo_path --api-key YOUR_KEY --model gpt-4 --api-version 2024-02-15-preview --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
❌ Problem 3: Server Not Passing AI Settings
The TypeScript service isn't passing your saved AI settings to the Python script.

🔧 Let me fix the server code and push it:

Opened server/services/pythonScriptService.ts

Found executeAnalysis method signature
Let me find the exact executeAnalysis method to fix it:


Found executeAnalysis method definition
Let me search the entire codebase for the executeAnalysis method:

Optimized Agent memory

Decided on debugging script dependencies (4 seconds)
The Python script is failing with exit code 1, which means there's an error during execution. Let me diagnose what's going wrong:


Executed echo "🔍 Testing Python environment on this system..." echo "Python version:" python --version 2>/dev/null || echo "python command not available" echo "" echo "Python3 version:" python3 --version 2>/dev/null || echo "python3 command not available" echo "" echo "Py launcher version (Windows):" py --version 2>/dev/null || echo "py command not available"

Agent ran into an error

Decided on dependency installation (5 seconds)
Found the issue! The Python script is failing because:

Missing Python dependencies - The script needs langgraph, langchain_core, and requests
AI credentials not being passed - The script exits with code 1 when no AI credentials are provided
Let me fix both issues:


Decided on AI credential passing (5 seconds)
Great! I installed the Python dependencies. Now I need to check how the AI credentials are being passed to the Python script. Looking at the script, it expects command line arguments for AI configuration:

--api-key
--model
--api-version
--base-url
But from the logs I saw, the command being executed was:

py C:\Users\...\default.py https://github.com/srigumm/dotnetcore-kafka-integration.git C:\Users\...\temp\clone_1758717751375
It's only passing the repo URL and repo path, but NOT the AI credentials! I need to check how the server is calling the Python script and make sure it passes the AI credentials from the saved settings.

Let me examine the Python script service to see how it constructs the command.
