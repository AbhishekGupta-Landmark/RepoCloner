# Git Repository Cloner & Analyzer

## Overview
An interactive web-based application that allows users to clone Git repositories from multiple providers (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket) and analyze them using AI-powered insights.

## Current State
- Multi-panel UI with repository cloning, file tree visualization, and AI analysis
- GitHub and GitLab authentication support with multiple methods (OAuth, PAT, credentials)
- OpenAI integration for code analysis
- C#-compatible backend architecture with extensible provider pattern

## Recent Changes
- 2025-10-01: **DYNAMIC ANALYSIS TYPES SYSTEM** - Implemented extensible configuration-driven architecture for analysis types
  - **AnalysisRegistry Service**: Auto-discovers Python scripts in scripts/ directory with metadata parsing (# ANALYSIS_ID, # ANALYSIS_LABEL)
  - **GET /api/analysis/types Endpoint**: Returns all available analysis types dynamically from registry
  - **AnalysisPanel UI Enhancement**: Dropdown now loads analysis types from API instead of hardcoded options
  - **Extensible Architecture**: New analysis types can be added by simply creating Python files in scripts/ directory
  - **Three Analysis Types Available**: kafka-to-servicebus (default), quick-migration (default2), quick-migration-1 (default3)
  - **GitHub Push**: Successfully pushed 15 files to feature/dynamic-analysis-types branch
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Existing analyze endpoint now accepts optional analysisType parameter, defaults to kafka-to-servicebus
- 2025-09-30: **KEY CHANGES JSON DESERIALIZATION** - Completed clean implementation of Key Changes display functionality
  - **Reverted to commit 1b2aa1ac**: Started with clean state to avoid regression issues
  - **Python Script Updates**: Enhanced AI response parsing to extract key_changes from bullet points without modifying prompt
  - **Backend JSON Deserialization**: Replaced regex-based text parsing with clean JSON deserialization from embedded JSON block
  - **Type System Consolidation**: Fixed duplicate interfaces and aligned snake_case (backend/JSON) with TypeScript types
  - **UI Key Changes Section**: Updated MigrationReportViewer to aggregate and display key_changes from report and diffs in yellow collapsible section
  - **Data Flow**: Clean end-to-end flow: Python AI response ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí Backend deserialization ‚Üí Frontend display
  - **No Regex**: Completely removed fragile regex-based key changes extraction and diff cleaning logic
- 2025-09-23: **UI/UX OPTIMIZATION & TESTING MILESTONE** - Completed grid layout fixes and comprehensive test updates
  - **Equal Height Grid Layout**: Implemented uniform card heights across all view modes (Simple & Details) with scrollable content areas
  - **Responsive Grid System**: Unified responsive layout with grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-5
  - **Enhanced Text Wrapping**: Improved natural word boundaries using break-normal and proper file path handling
  - **"Show More" Functionality**: Fixed Evidence section expansion in Details view with proper height management
  - **Comprehensive Test Fixes**: Updated all unit tests to match current component interfaces (TechnologyShowcase, TechnologyDisplay, MainPage)
  - **Test Coverage Improvement**: Fixed failing tests to achieve 71 passing tests out of 79 total (significant improvement)
  - **Technology Stack Auto-Display**: Fixed Technology Stack section to immediately show detected technologies when cloning repositories using dedicated React Query endpoint  
  - **Sidebar Scrolling**: Made left sidebar scrollable to access all content without resizing screen
  - **Height Management**: Implemented proper CSS flexbox height constraints for better viewport utilization
- **MAJOR TESTING MILESTONE** - Achieved comprehensive test coverage with 58+ tests passing across all components
- Implemented complete testing infrastructure: frontend components, backend APIs, E2E workflows, hooks, and context
- Added comprehensive test utilities with stable renderWithProviders, MSW integration, and behavioral testing
- Updated README with extensive testing documentation and development guide
- Completed cleanup of unused resources: cleaned temp/ directory, removed old coverage reports, and unnecessary files
- Enhanced project documentation with detailed testing commands and coverage reporting
- 2025-09-22: Successfully pushed latest changes to GitHub repository
- Fixed multi-signin functionality to always show "Add another account" option
- PAT authentication now always available regardless of OAuth configuration  
- Implemented targeted Vite error overlay blocking while preserving UI functionality
- Enhanced authentication flow with improved user experience
- 2025-09-12: Initial implementation with working web UI
- Fixed storage interface to support repositories and analysis reports
- Added Express session support for authentication
- Configured OpenAI integration with API key

## User Preferences
- Wants C#-compatible backend interface architecture
- Requires GitHub integration without using Replit's GitHub connector (user dismissed it)
- Needs support for multiple Git providers with extensible pattern
- OpenAI integration for code analysis and report generation

## Project Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript as bridge to C# backend
- Storage: In-memory storage (MemStorage) as per guidelines
- Authentication: Session-based with multiple provider support

## Important Notes
- GitHub authentication currently uses manual implementation instead of Replit connector
- User dismissed connector:ccfg_github_01K4B9XD3VRVD2F99YM91YTCAF integration (dismissed again 2025-09-23)
- GitHub operations use GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN secret for authentication instead of Replit's GitHub integration
- User prefers manual git push using their personal access token via shell commands
- OpenAI API key configured and ready for code analysis features

## MVP Features Status
- ‚úÖ Multi-panel UI layout working with responsive design
- ‚úÖ File tree visualization implemented with scrollable sidebar
- ‚úÖ Technology Stack display with auto-refresh and 5-5 grid layout
