# Git Repository Cloner & Analyzer

## Overview
An interactive web-based application that allows users to clone Git repositories from multiple providers (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket) and analyze them using AI-powered insights.

## Current State
- Multi-panel UI with repository cloning, file tree visualization, and AI analysis
- GitHub and GitLab authentication support with multiple methods (OAuth, PAT, credentials)
- OpenAI integration for code analysis
- C#-compatible backend architecture with extensible provider pattern

## Recent Changes
- 2025-09-30: **PURE JSON DESERIALIZATION + KEY CHANGES UI** - Final implementation of JSON-first architecture
  - **Backend**: Removed ALL regex cleanup patterns - now pure JSON deserialization in `convertJsonToMigrationData()`
  - **UI Enhancement**: Added dedicated Key Changes section (yellow, collapsible, positioned before Notes)
  - **UI Layout**: Key Changes (CheckCircle icon) ‚Üí Notes (AlertTriangle icon) ‚Üí Code Diffs
  - **Data Flow**: Python outputs clean JSON ‚Üí Backend deserializes directly ‚Üí UI displays three separate sections
  - **JSON Schema**: `{meta, keyChanges[], notes[], diffs[{path, diff, description}], inventory[]}`
  - **Impact**: Simplified parsing, deterministic data extraction, professional UI presentation
  - **Commits**: bfbd6372 (pure JSON backend), 17344068 (Key Changes UI) on fix/check-again-and-url branch
- 2025-09-30: **JSON-FIRST PARSING ARCHITECTURE** - Initial implementation of structured JSON parsing
  - **Previous Issue**: Complex regex patterns failed to reliably extract Key Changes and Notes from AI-generated markdown
  - **User Request**: User wanted pure JSON deserialization without regex safety nets
  - **Solution**: Implemented structured JSON output alongside markdown for deterministic parsing
  - **Python Changes**: Script now outputs `migration-report-{timestamp}.json` with clean schema
  - **Backend Changes**: Three-tier parsing priority - (1) Embedded JSON in markdown, (2) Standalone .json file, (3) Regex fallback
  - **Type System**: Created MigrationSection interface, changed sections from Record to MigrationSection[], added top-level keyChanges/notes arrays
- 2025-09-30: **CRITICAL URL STRIPPING BUG FIX** - Fixed EPAM proxy authentication failure
  - **Root Cause**: Backend was stripping `?api-version=` query parameter from configured URL
  - **Issue**: EPAM proxy requires api-version in URL for routing/authentication, removal caused 401 errors
  - **Fix**: Removed URL modification logic - now uses URL exactly as user configured it
  - **Impact**: EPAM proxy authentication works correctly, AI analysis restored to working state
- 2025-09-30: **PYTHON ERROR LOGGING FIX** - Fixed missing error messages when AI API calls fail
  - **Root Cause**: Python script errors were printed to stdout only, but stdout was truncated in logs
  - **Issue**: When API calls failed, error details weren't visible - only "exit code 1" shown
  - **Fix**: Added stderr output for all exception handlers so errors are properly captured by backend
  - **Impact**: Error messages now visible in logs, making debugging much easier
- 2025-09-30: **WINDOWS LINE ENDING BUG FIX** - Fixed code diff parsing on Windows systems
  - **Root Cause**: Regex patterns only matched Unix `\n` line endings, failed on Windows `\r\n` line endings
  - **Issue**: Diff blocks weren't extracted, entire content dumped into description field causing garbled display
  - **Fix**: Updated regex to match both `[\r\n]+` for cross-platform compatibility
  - **Impact**: Code diffs now parse correctly on Windows, proper separation of description and code blocks
- 2025-09-30: **FALLBACK REPORT BUG FIX** - Deleted old fallback migration reports to prevent stale data
  - **Root Cause**: Old "static analysis" fallback reports from previous runs were persisting in temp directory
  - **Issue**: Python script generated new AI report, but backend picked up old fallback file instead
  - **Fix**: Added cleanup logic to delete ALL old `migration-report-*.md` files before generating new one
  - **Impact**: Only fresh AI-generated reports are displayed, no more fallback data pollution
- 2025-09-30: **CRITICAL UI CACHE BUG FIX** - Fixed "Check Again" not updating UI after successful analysis
  - **Root Cause**: Cache invalidation only happened on error, not success - UI showed old failed report even when new analysis succeeded
  - **Fix**: Moved `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` to run ALWAYS (both success and failure paths) in `analyzeCode()`
  - **Impact**: "Check Again" button now properly refreshes UI with new analysis results
- 2025-09-30: **MIGRATION ANALYSIS UI FIXES** - Completed critical bug fixes for migration report display
  - **Fixed Report ID Propagation**: `createPythonScriptReport` now returns report ID, fixing issue where successful analysis showed error screen
  - **Removed Fallback Logic**: Verified Python script correctly exits with error when AI not configured (no unwanted fallback reports)
  - **Fixed Key Changes Duplication**: Enhanced markdown parsing to extract "Key Changes" from descriptions into separate array, preventing duplicate display
  - **Optimized UI Caching**: Added `staleTime: 0` and smart polling that stops when analysis complete
  - **Fixed Parser Bug**: Changed from `parseMarkdownToMigrationData` to `extractStructuredData` to match expected data structure
  - **Notes Display**: Verified Notes are displayed separately in "Important Notes" section (already implemented)
- 2025-09-23: **UI/UX OPTIMIZATION & TESTING MILESTONE** - Completed grid layout fixes and comprehensive test updates
  - **Equal Height Grid Layout**: Implemented uniform card heights across all view modes (Simple & Details) with scrollable content areas
  - **Responsive Grid System**: Unified responsive layout with grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-5
  - **Enhanced Text Wrapping**: Improved natural word boundaries using break-normal and proper file path handling
  - **"Show More" Functionality**: Fixed Evidence section expansion in Details view with proper height management
  - **Comprehensive Test Fixes**: Updated all unit tests to match current component interfaces (TechnologyShowcase, TechnologyDisplay, MainPage)
  - **Test Coverage Improvement**: Fixed failing tests to achieve 71 passing tests out of 79 total (significant improvement)
  - **Technology Stack Auto-Display**: Fixed Technology Stack section to immediately show detected technologies when cloning repositories using dedicated React Query endpoint  
  - **Sidebar Scrolling**: Made left sidebar scrollable to access all content without resizing screen
  - **Height Management**: Implemented proper CSS flexbox height constraints for better viewport utilization
- **MAJOR TESTING MILESTONE** - Achieved comprehensive test coverage with 58+ tests passing across all components

## Project Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript as bridge to C# backend

- Authentication: Session-based with multiple provider support

## Important Notes
- GitHub authentication currently uses manual implementation instead of Replit connector
- User dismissed connector:ccfg_github_01K4B9XD3VRVD2F99YM91YTCAF integration (dismissed again 2025-09-23)
- GitHub operations use GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN secret for authentication instead of Replit's GitHub integration
