# Git Repository Cloner & Analyzer

## Overview
An interactive web-based application that allows users to clone Git repositories from multiple providers (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket) and analyze them using AI-powered insights.

## Current State
- Multi-panel UI with repository cloning, file tree visualization, and AI analysis
- GitHub and GitLab authentication support with multiple methods (OAuth, PAT, credentials)
- OpenAI integration for code analysis
- C#-compatible backend architecture with extensible provider pattern

## Recent Changes
- 2025-09-23: **MAJOR TESTING MILESTONE** - Achieved comprehensive test coverage with 58+ tests passing across all components
- Implemented complete testing infrastructure: frontend components, backend APIs, E2E workflows, hooks, and context
- Added comprehensive test utilities with stable renderWithProviders, MSW integration, and behavioral testing
- Updated README with extensive testing documentation and development guide
- Completed cleanup of unused resources: cleaned temp/ directory, removed old coverage reports, and unnecessary files
- Enhanced project documentation with detailed testing commands and coverage reporting
- 2025-09-22: Successfully pushed latest changes to GitHub repository
- Fixed multi-signin functionality to always show "Add another account" option
- PAT authentication now always available regardless of OAuth configuration  
- Implemented targeted Vite error overlay blocking while preserving UI functionality
- Enhanced authentication flow with improved user experience
- 2025-09-12: Initial implementation with working web UI
- Fixed storage interface to support repositories and analysis reports
- Added Express session support for authentication
- Configured OpenAI integration with API key

## User Preferences
- Wants C#-compatible backend interface architecture
- Requires GitHub integration without using Replit's GitHub connector (user dismissed it)
- Needs support for multiple Git providers with extensible pattern
- OpenAI integration for code analysis and report generation

## Project Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript as bridge to C# backend
- Storage: In-memory storage (MemStorage) as per guidelines
- Authentication: Session-based with multiple provider support

## Important Notes
- GitHub authentication currently uses manual implementation instead of Replit connector
- User dismissed connector:ccfg_github_01K4B9XD3VRVD2F99YM91YTCAF integration (dismissed again 2025-09-23)
- GitHub operations use GITHUB_TOKEN secret for authentication instead of Replit's GitHub integration
- Need to implement GitHub authentication with user-provided credentials/tokens
- OpenAI API key configured and ready for code analysis features

## MVP Features Status
